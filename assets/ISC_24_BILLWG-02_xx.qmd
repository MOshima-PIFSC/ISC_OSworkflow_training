**Summary**

This study presents a multi-species spatiotemporal statistical model to
produce standardized catch per unit effort (CPUE) series for albacore
tuna, bigeye tuna, and striped marlin in the North Pacific. The model
incorporates interspecies interactions to reflect the effects of
targeting practices. Using data from 1975 to 2023, standardization was
performed for both the North Pacific and Western and Central North
Pacific Ocean regions. Significant spikes in the standardized CPUE were
observed for albacore and striped marlin, which may indicate overfitting
to high-CPUE years. Computational challenges arose when incorporating
vessel license numbers due to their large number and potential
reassignment across vessels. An alternative approach using vessel names
was considered but also requires substantial preprocessing due to
inconsistent recording formats. The effects of hooks between floats
(HBF) were found to be statistically significant, though potential
confounding factors related to material changes around 1994 need to be
considered. Preliminary spatiotemporal CPUE distributions reveal
species-specific abundance hotspots, with some exhibiting strong
seasonal patterns. Further research, including related species such as
blue marlin or black marlin, may enhance the understanding of these
patterns.
